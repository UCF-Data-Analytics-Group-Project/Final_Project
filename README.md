# Telco Customer Predictive Analysis

## Project Overview

Telco, a telecommunications company, has assigned us to perform a predictive analysis based on established data, with the goal of identifying future customer churn trends. In addition to the historical data, we will use statistical algorithms and build predictive models to identify the probability of future outcomes. We will present our findings with a Google dashboard displaying various types of pragmatic visualization in order to comprehensively convey our results. This analysis will provide Telco with the necessary insights to improve upon the current marketing and operational processes, reduce customer churn, and increase profits.
